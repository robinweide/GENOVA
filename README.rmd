*Explore the Hi-Cs!*

The increase in interest for Hi-C methods in the chromatin community has led to a need for more user-friendly and powerful analysis methods. The few currently available software packages for Hi-C do not allow a researcher to quickly summarize and visualize their data. An easy to use software package, which can generate a comprehensive set of publication-quality plots, would allow researchers to swiftly go from raw Hi-C data to interpretable results. 

Here, we present **GEN**ome **O**rganisation **V**isual **A**nalytics (GENOVA): a software suite to perform in-depth analyses on various levels of genome organisation, using Hi-C data. GENOVA facilitates the comparison between multiple datasets and supports the majority of mapping-pipelines.

GENOVA directly reads data from:

- HiC-pro
- cooler
- juicer

## Installation

You can install GENOVA from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("robinweide/GENOVA")
```

## Note to long-time users
Version 1.0 will contain a massive overhaul, which will result in breaking nearly every analysis. To provide legacy support, we made the [ye olde lighthouse](https://github.com/robinweide/GENOVA/releases/tag/v0.95) release. This can be installed with `devtools::install_github("robinweide/GENOVA@v0.95")`. Furthermore, if you have custom scripts based on the output of `construct.experiment()`, you can use v1 and set `legacy=TRUE` in `loadContacts()` to get a similar output. This, of course, also allows you to load .cooler and .hic files in pre-v1 versions :+1:.

## Support
We have provided a quite lengthy [vignette](https://github.com/robinweide/GENOVA/blob/master/vignettes/GENOVA_vignette.pdf), so please read that first. If there are still unanswered questions, please use the [issue-tracker](https://github.com/robinweide/GENOVA/issues).

## Publication
Please see our preprint on bioRxiv: [Hi-C Analysis with GENOVA: a case study with cohesin variants](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2021/01/24/2021.01.22.427620).
