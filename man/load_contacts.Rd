}
\arguments{
\item{signal_path}{Full path to an Hi-C file. This could be \*.matrix (for HiCpro), \*.cooler or \*.hic (for juicer).}

\item{indices_path}{Full path the HiC-pro-like index-file. Required when `signal_path` is \*.matrix.}

\item{resolution}{Set the desired resolution of the matrix when using juicer-data.}

\item{sample_name}{The name of the sample.}

\item{centromeres}{One of the following: \itemize{
 \item \code{NULL} (default) for empirically estimating centromeres by 
 searching for the largest stretch of empty bins.
 \item A \code{data.frame} with three columns per chromosome:
 chromosome name, start-position and end-positions of centromeric regions.
 \item \code{FALSE} to set no centromere information.
}}

\item{colour}{colour associated with sample.}

\item{z_norm}{Normalise the matrices per-chromosome with a Z-score.}

\item{scale_bp}{Scale contacts to have genome-wide sum of `scale_bp` reads (default: 1e9). Set to NULL to skip this.}

\item{scale_cis}{Only scale with cis-contacts.}

\item{balancing}{TRUE (default) will perform matrix balancing for .cooler and KR for.hic.}

\item{legacy}{Get a pre-v1 object (mimics the output of construct.experiment.)}

\item{verbose}{Do you want updates during the construction?}

\item{location}{A \code{character} vector of locations. Either chromosome
names, e.g. \code{"chr3"}, or chromosomal locations e.g. 
\code{"chr3:30000000-90000000"}}
}
\value{
An contacts-object, which is a named list of contacts, indices and 
attributes for a Hi-C matrix of a given sample at a given resolution.
}
\description{
Make an object which holds the most needed information of a HiC-experiment at a given resolution.
}
\note{
Some reference genomes have very small "random" or "patch" chromosomes,
which can have zero contacts mapped to it (at certain resolutions).
`load_contacts` checks this and omits these chromosomes in the resulting
experiment-object. The RMCHROM-flag will also be set to TRUE: this will
help other GENOVA-functions to deal better with this problem. There is a
slight performance-cost during the construction of the object, however.
